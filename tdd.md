#TDD

TDD can stand for "Test Driven Development" or "Test Driven Design".

In this tutorial I am going to use TDD to start development of code to control my Phillips hue lights.
These are light bulbs which can be controlled ( turned on, turned off, dimmed, changed color, set on timers ) by making API calls to a Hue bridge.

This tutorial shows the important techniques. 
A tutorial showing all the details of this would be in multiple parts ( I may add this later )

##Create solution

I created a new console application in Visual Studio 2015 called Hue.CSharp.TDD
Next I created a new "Unit Test" project on the same solution called "Hue.CSharp.TDD.Tests"
And renamed the auto generated class UnitTest1.cs to BridgeTests.cs

We are going to do all our initial work in the file BridgeTests.cs
Which currently looks like this
```c#
using System;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

namespace Hue.CSharp.TDD.Tests
{
    [TestClass]
    public class BridgeTests
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void TestMethod1()
        {
        }
    }
}
```

OK where to start ?

Well in order to control any lights we need to be able to connect to the bridge.
The bridge is a physical device which connects to a internet router via a patch cable.
To setup a bulb we need to connect it to the bridge.
We can then control the bulb by sending commands to the Bridge via its Restful API.

Before a application can use the bridge it needs to create a new username.
This involves sending a command to the bridge and pressing the button on the bridge within 30 seconds ( for security, proving we have physical access ).

```c#
using System;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

namespace Hue.CSharp.TDD.Tests
{
    public interface IHueBridge
    {
        string GetNewUserName();
    }

    public class HueBridge: IHueBridge
    {
        public string GetNewUserName()
        {
            return null;
        }
    }

    [TestClass]
    public class BridgeTests
    {
        [TestMethod]
        public void CanGenerateNewUserName()
        {
            IHueBridge bridge = new HueBridge();

            string newUserName = bridge.GetNewUserName();
            Assert.IsNotNull(newUserName);
        } 
    }
}
```

OK we created a abstraction for the Hue bridge by adding a IHueBridge interface and a concrete type HueBridge.
Then we added a test for CanGenerateNewUserName() and added this method.
The test fails as expected, because no username is generated.
Thats as expected.
TDD = test driven development.
We create a failing test ( red ) then make it pass ( go green ), thats the normal flow in TDD

##Inversion of Control ( IOC ) with structuremap
I can immeditely see a problem, looking at
```c#
IHueBridge bridge = new HueBridge();
```

Our code should follow SOLID ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design) )
And the D is "Dependency inversion principle"
"one should â€œDepend upon Abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions"

OK so our variable may be defined as the interface type, but the instantation of concrete class HueBridge is hardcoded into the test.
Lets fix that first.

Install the Nuget package : "StructureMap" and configure the IOC container in a test intitialiation method.
Remove the hardcoding of the concrete HueBridge from the test.
This gives us :

```c#
using System;
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;

namespace Hue.CSharp.TDD.Tests
{

    public interface IHueBridge
    {
        string GetNewUserName();
    }

    public class HueBridge: IHueBridge
    {
        public string GetNewUserName()
        {
            return null;
        }
    }

    [TestClass]
    public class BridgeTests
    {
        static StructureMap.Container iocContainer;

        [TestInitialize]
        public void TestInit()
        {
            iocContainer = new StructureMap.Container(_ =>
            {
                _.For<IHueBridge>().Use<HueBridge>();
            });
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void CanGenerateNewUserName()
        {
            IHueBridge bridge = iocContainer.GetInstance<IHueBridge>();

            string newUserName = bridge.GetNewUserName();
            Assert.IsNotNull(newUserName);
        }
    }
}
```

##Mocking ( with Moq )
We could continue building out the bridge tests and getting them to pass.
However I would rather talk about mocking as this is meant to be a relatively short tutorial.

Lets create a light bulb ( interface and class ).
Which implements off and on.
The bulb is associated with a bridge.

The first thing is we dont want to connect the bulb to an actual physical bridge.
That would make it difficult to test without physical access to a real system.
Instead we want to create a mock bridge for our light bulb tests.

First is to install the NuGet package Moq
Then create a new unittest file called BulbTests.cs

So as stated, we are testing the bulbs logic here
We dont want to test the bridge, that has its own tests.
In fact we dont want the bulb testing to rely on having a physical working bridge at all.
Or a working IHueBridge implementation.
Which is why we mock the IHueBridge in the following code.


So we generate our failing test : 
```c#
using Microsoft.VisualStudio.TestTools.UnitTesting;
using Moq;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Text;

namespace Hue.CSharp.TDD.Tests
{
    public interface IHueBulb {
        IHueBridge HueBridge { get; set; }
        string BulbName { get; set; }

        void TurnOn();
        void TurnOff();
        bool IsOn();
        bool IsOff();
    };

    public class HueBulb : IHueBulb
    {
        public IHueBridge HueBridge { get; set; }
        public string BulbName { get; set; }

        public bool IsOff()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }

        public bool IsOn()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }

        public void TurnOff()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }

        public void TurnOn()
        {
            throw new NotImplementedException();
        }
    }

    [TestClass]
    public class BulbTests
    {
        static StructureMap.Container iocContainer;

        [TestInitialize]
        public void TestInit()
        {
            iocContainer = new StructureMap.Container(_ =>
            {
                _.For<IHueBulb>().Use<HueBulb>();
            });
        }

        [TestMethod]
        public void LandingBulbTurnsOn()
        {
            var mockBridge = new Mock<IHueBridge>();
            IHueBridge bridge = mockBridge.Object;

            IHueBulb bulb = iocContainer.GetInstance<IHueBulb>();
            bulb.HueBridge = bridge;
            bulb.BulbName  = "landing";

            bulb.TurnOn();
            Assert.IsTrue( bulb.IsOn(), "bulb didnt turn on");
        }

    }
}
```

We can now write the implementation code to turn this test green.

A really important thing to note is the code we are writing to interact with our bulb :

```c#
IHueBulb bulb = iocContainer.GetInstance<IHueBulb>();
bulb.HueBridge = bridge;
bulb.BulbName  = "landing";

bulb.TurnOn();
```

TDD can stand for "Test Driven Design"

You should examine the code above and decide if you are writing the best API.
i.e. is the code which accesses API clear, is it easy to discover, does it encourage best practices.

If not refactor the test code to be optimal
Then amend the API implementation so it compiles again, and the test is green.
